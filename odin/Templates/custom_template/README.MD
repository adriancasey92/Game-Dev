# Odin - Custom Template!

This template contains the following:
* Hot-Reload template - Karl Z.
* Handle-Map library - Karl Z.
* Atlas-Map library - Karl Z.

I have also created the following:

* Quadtree.odin - Flat array quadtree structure that is adapted to use Handles from the handle_map library


Modifications:

- build_hot_reload.bat - Added in Atlas-Map build line to allow user to hot-reload and generate new atlas. 
                    NOTE: This can cause problems and often times requires a restart, as some textures may
                          cease to work.
